- 👋 Hi, I’m @galarunning
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and ambedded software development and are currently in a GNSS tech company as a Senior Technical Support Engineer. Striving to become a software engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, Python and C# to an intermediate level. Currently mainly using C# to create WPF GUI Solutions. 
- 🏃 One of my other passion and how I spend most of my time is running :). I have already completed 5 marathons all under 3 hours and a 100 km ultra in 12 hours.
- 📈 I am always looking to get better in everything I do, so please, if you have any criticism or suggestions to improve my code get in touch.
